## Mode of execution

### Full interactive track 

***(GUI + progress log + full error reporting + code interaction possible)***

As of the current version the full interactive mode does not require any deeper knowledge of R coding nor requires computational skills but rather can be operated by anyone using Studio and the Graphical user interphases (GUIs) provided. 



#### **To start Metapolish simply follow the steps below:**
